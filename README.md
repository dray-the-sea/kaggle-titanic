# kaggle-titanic
Kaggle's Titanic ML competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/evaluation)

This project is the first ML project outside the course and a test of running outside Jupyter Notebooks. 


Goals: 
- comeplete the project 
- have some re-usable functions stored outside Jupyter Notebook
- use Git for source control


Project structure from ZTM: 
    
    0. environment setup: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/17681882 lecture 153 to import or 177 to start from scratch (min7)

	1. Problem Definition 
        predict if a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

	2. Data
        Inputs: 
            - in the /data folder 
            - key: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

        Output format: 
            - PassengerId (sorted in any order)
            - Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)
	
    3. Evaluation 
        Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict, aka accuracy
