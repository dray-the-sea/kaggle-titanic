# kaggle-titanic
Kaggle's Titanic ML competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/evaluation)

This project is the first ML project outside the course and a test of running outside Jupyter Notebooks. 


Goals: 
- comeplete the project 
- have some re-usable functions stored outside Jupyter Notebook
- use Git for source control
